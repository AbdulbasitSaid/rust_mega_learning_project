# Rust Mega Learning Project

## Project Description

This project is a structured, long-term roadmap to master **programming, mathematics, computer science, software engineering, databases, system design, machine learning, and robotics/mechatronics** — all with applied Rust projects at every step.

The philosophy: Books are the curriculum. Projects are the exams.
After finishing each book or module, you will create a Rust project that applies the knowledge gained.

The end goal is not a single product, but to become highly skilled at problem solving, systems thinking, and practical engineering.

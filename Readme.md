## Study Guide

### Daily time management

- Dedicate 3 hours a day every day.

  For practical resource, use the following strategy:

  > learn (50 mins) --> break(10 mins) --> practice (80 mins) --> break(10 mins) --> review (30 mins)
>

- for theory resources:

  > learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> \
  learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> \
  learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> review (25 mins)

- Use Sundays for reflection and Dev-log
  > review resource 1 (30 mins) --> dev log (50 min) --> \
  break (10 mins) --> \
  review resource 2 (30 mins) --> dev log (50 min)

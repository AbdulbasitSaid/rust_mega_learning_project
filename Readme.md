### Phase 1 App Milestone

- [ ] 🎮 MVP of the gamified app (login, user profile, scoring system, simple animation using Flutter + Rive)
- [ ] 📘 First gamified module: Basic Math
- [ ] 🏗️ App core engineered using solid SE principles (design patterns, clean code, refactoring mindset)
- [ ] 🗄️ Backend in Rust with database (PostgreSQL) + gRPC/REST APIs
- [ ] 🧩 Modular design so future topics (DSA, algebra, etc.) plug in easily
- [ ] 🚀 CI/CD pipeline with automated tests + secure deployments

## Phase 2  — DSA System design and more maths

🥅 Goal: Deepen your CS knowledge, maths and expand app modules.

- [ ] 🎮 Add Physics gamified module (forces, motion, energy simulated interactively)

## Phase 5 Cooking physics and research

🥅 Goal: Learn physics, how to research and add more more physics modules

### Phase 5 Books and resources

- [ ] 🎮 Add research literacy module (teach problem-solving & scientific method in gamified way)
- [ ] 🌐 Grow app into multi-platform product with paid tiers + community features
- [ ] ⚒️ Keep improve app modules

## Study Guide

### Daily time management

- Dedicate 3 hours a day every day.

  For practical resource, use the following strategy:

  > learn (50 mins) --> break(10 mins) --> practice (80 mins) --> break(10 mins) --> review (30 mins)

- for theory resources:

  > learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> \
  learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> \
  learn (25 mins) --> break (5 mins) --> review (25 mins)

- Use Sundays for reflection and Dev-log
  > review resource 1 (30 mins) --> dev log (50 min) --> \
  break (10 mins) --> \
  review resource 2 (30 mins) --> dev log (50 min)

### Study progression strategy

- Study two resource in parallel until completion by dedicating a day for one resource:

  > MON == resource 1 --> \
  TUE == resource 2 --> \
  WED == resource 1 --> \
  THU == resource 2 --> \
  FRI == resource 1 --> \
  SAT == resource 2 --> \
  SUN == review and dev-log: resource 1 --> resource 2

### Rules

- Complete all resources before working on milestones
- Milestones should also only be dedicated 3 hours a day.
- Milestones must be completed before moving to next phase.

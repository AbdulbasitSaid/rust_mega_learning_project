# Year Self-Learning University — System

**Note:** Each *Level* should take **at least 6 months**, with 1 year being a realistic pace for most learners.  
If you already have experience and can dedicate significant time (e.g., daily study blocks, weekend revision), you may progress faster.  
The focus should be **depth and mastery**, not speed.

**Principle:**  

- Books = curriculum  
- Projects = exams  
- Rust is the **primary implementation language** for all software concepts
